A Cochrane review is considered the highest level of scientific evidence becauae it evaluates and scores all existing studies on a particular scientific topic. The masks don't make a difference but handwriting all by itself decreased infections by 1/3. 
Wrong, that study was about mandate adherence not masks themselves. Read it again if you missed it. Covid is transmitted in the air, not fomites. N95 masks make a big difference.
These people are freaks, let them live in their world of fear
Did you bother reading the review you cited? "The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement,  and relatively low adherence with the interventions during the studies  hampers drawing firm conclusions."

I‚Äôve often heard it claimed that covid causes myocarditis. A large population-based study finds that it doesn‚Äôt. https://mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/8/2219
Don't know how many studies (vaxx sponsored?) you read, but Pfizer recently had to relaese several pages of known side-effects, myocarditis being one of them. Are you aware of the almost total censorship of doctors/scientists who object to the "vaccine"?
Another lie used to coerce/scare people into vaccinating blows up
I‚Äôm sure everything is causing myocarditis except the jab

The COVID vaccines likely averted 19.8m deaths worldwide in 2021, according to new modeling published in @TheLancet. For many of us, people we know are alive today because of the vaccine. Truly one of the greatest triumphs of science over disease ever. https://thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext
"likely" so you really have no clue We knew that already
What a miracle being still alive without any poison shot.
It is a pity #vaccinemandates and #vaccinepassports  seem to have created a whole new group of #antivaxxers.  Informed consent is better. #science #liberty
Unfortunately, no one will ever know how many lives could have been saved if (the proven to be safe) #ivermectin and #hcq had not been banned.

Study from 2/2022 linking COVID-19 to a sig increased risk of cardiac events 30+ days after infection. Combine this with the study I posted showing cardiac issues being 1 of the top 5 issues of long COVID.  Maybe stop blaming the vax for all sudden deaths? https://nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3
I've seen a number of older patients get a fib and other arrhythmias post COVID including my dad who needed a pacemaker.
Do you think this could also cause a decrease in the hearts electrical system? I believe that‚Äôs bradycardia (?). I haven‚Äôt read a whole lot about that specific issue being linked, but it seems like there is a number of conditions after Covid
I‚Äôve had POTS-like symptoms since covid infection even with 2 vaccines and a booster. Scary to think what would have happened if I was unvaxxed. (For clarity: vaccine and booster done a year before covid infection, no symptoms until after infection)
'In this study involving 153,760 people with COVID-19, 5,637,647
contemporary controls and 5,859,411 historical controls‚Äîwhich,
altogether, correspond to 12,095,836 person-years of follow-up‚Äîwe
provide evidence that, beyond the first 30 d of infection, people with
COVID-19 exhibited increased risks and 12-month burdens of incident cardiovascular diseases, including cerebrovascular disorders,
dysrhythmias, inflammatory heart disease, ischemic heart disease,
heart failure, thromboembolic disease and other cardiac disorders.' (Page 5)

Well, given that mRNA was being developed to counter cancer by travelling to parts of the body that were difficult to reach conventionally, it was surprising that there was a claim that the mRNA (messenger RNA) would remain in the jab site.
A good rule of thumb is to listen to everything, "they" say and know the truth is opposite.

Long Covid is indeed a multisystemic illness Already affected millions, and the number keeps increasing Diagnostic and treatment options are currently insufficient  We urgently need more clinical trials to meet the challenge of #LongCovid https://nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2
It's only multisystemic because it's impairing the vagus nerve which controls everything.
We know how bad it is. Now convince our government to take it seriously. The no sooner get elected and say we are free and we will never wear masks or get vaccinated. Also all the data collected is on the #mRNA maybe its time to collect data on #Novavax
Is there any way to get past the paywall? This is such important information for the general public to have
'Long COVID is a multisystemic illness encompassing ME/CFS, dysautonomia, impacts on multiple organ systems, and vascular and clotting
abnormalities. It has already debilitated millions of individuals worldwide, and that number is continuing to grow. On the basis of more than
2 years of research on long COVID and decades of research on conditions such as ME/CFS, a significant proportion of individuals with long
COVID may have lifelong disabilities if no action is taken. Diagnostic and
treatment options are currently insufficient, and many clinical trials
are urgently needed to rigorously test treatments that address hypothesized underlying biological mechanisms, including viral persistence,
neuroinflammation, excessive blood clotting and autoimmunity' (Page 11)

Absolute rubbish. The author clearly doesn't understand the basic concept of a *confidence interval.*
Wow. The üëá reminds me of the first chapter of Edward Hooper‚Äôs *The River* on AIDS. Horrifying. Thanks so much for posting. And thanks to Kenji Yamamoto, the author, for speaking out. Everyone should read his letter.  @MDinCanada
According to European Medicines Agency recommendations, frequent COVID-19 booster shots could adversely affect the immune response and may not be feasible.
'Recently, The Lancet published a study on the
effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the waning of
immunity with time [1]. The study showed that immune
function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after
the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine
was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals.
These findings were more pronounced in older adults
and individuals with pre-existing conditions. ' (Page 1)

Just want to remind everyone that peer reviewed science has now found that ‚Äúat a global level, PRE-VACCINATION IFR may have been as low as 0.03% and 0.07% for 0‚Äì59 and 0‚Äì69 year old people, respectively.‚Äù This was never worse than the flu. We were lied to. https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512201982X
This was known well before the rollout of the mRNA experimental prophylactic. Pharma saw a huge payday and went all in. Fear is an extremely powerful marketing angle, making it free only helped their campaigns. No liability for the outcome costs sealed the deal.
The information was there in the beginning.
Oh please ‚Ä¶ I have friends very ill with long Covid ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt peddle lies üëãüò≥

'Sensitivity analyses
considering all 38 countries with seroprevalence data that were identified in our systematic search showed that median IFR might be up to a
third lower than the estimates produced by our main analysis, e.g.
approximately 0.03% in the 0‚Äì59 years age group and 0.06‚Äì0.08% in
the 0‚Äì69 years old group.' (Page 6)

1 in 10,000 16-17 year olds ended up in hospital with myocarditis after vaccination in USA. Tip of the myocarditis iceberg. First do no harm. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788346
But look at reporting rates for 18-24 age group, only group including both Pfzr and Moderna. 52.4 and 56.3 per mil respectively. I.e. almost =, despite higher Mod dose that seems to confer longer protection. So how did Hippisley-Cox get 4-5x more risk for Mod? Where‚Äôs the data?
How does this compare to mycarditis rates of those catching Covid? I think It‚Äôs important to know, so true risk can be assessed.
How does this compare to similar age group over similar timeframe before vaccination implementation?
' The reporting rates of myocarditis were
highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent
males aged 12 to 15 years (70.73 [95% CI, 61.68-81.11] per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), in adolescent males
aged 16 to 17 years (105.86 [95% CI, 91.65-122.27] per million
doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), and in young men aged 18 to
24 years (52.43 [95% CI, 45.56-60.33] per million doses of the

Cannabinoids Block Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the Emerging Variants
As a complement to vaccines, small-molecule therapeutic agents are needed to treat or prevent infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, which cause COVID-19. Affinity selection‚Äìmass spectrometry was used for the discovery of botanical ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Cannabinoid acids from hemp (Cannabis sativa) were found to be allosteric as well as orthosteric ligands with micromolar affinity for the spike protein. In follow-up virus neutralization assays, cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid prevented infection of human epithelial cells by a pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevented entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Importantly, cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid were equally effective against the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant B.1.1.7 and the beta variant B.1.351. Orally bioavailable and with a long history of safe human use, these cannabinoids, isolated or in hemp extracts, have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Hmmm, pot as a preventative for Covid. Or you could stick with bleach, urine, and horse deworming paste...
It's important to note that the study found that HEMP (not marijuana) binds the spike protein and may be used in future treatments and vaccines, an no, just smoking weed isn't the same. Sorry, dudes. But still super cool science.

The first peer-reviewed investigation into the global death toll of COVID-19. Using excess death data from nearly 200 countries across 2020 and 2021 it estimates more than 18 million deaths from COVID-19, 3x higher than official estimates.
https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02796-3/fulltext
Although reported COVID-19 deaths between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, totalled 5¬∑94 million worldwide, we estimate that 18¬∑2 million (95% uncertainty interval 17¬∑1‚Äì19¬∑6) people died worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic (as measured by excess mortality) over that period. The global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 120¬∑3 deaths (113¬∑1‚Äì129¬∑3) per 100‚Äâ000 of the population, and excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100‚Äâ000 of the population in 21 countries. The number of excess deaths due to COVID-19 was largest in the regions of south Asia, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern Europe. At the country level, the highest numbers of cumulative excess deaths due to COVID-19 were estimated in India (4¬∑07 million [3¬∑71‚Äì4¬∑36]), the USA (1¬∑13 million [1¬∑08‚Äì1¬∑18]), Russia (1¬∑07 million [1¬∑06‚Äì1¬∑08]), Mexico (798‚Äâ000 [741‚Äâ000‚Äì867‚Äâ000]), Brazil (792‚Äâ000 [730‚Äâ000‚Äì847‚Äâ000]), Indonesia (736‚Äâ000 [594‚Äâ000‚Äì955‚Äâ000]), and Pakistan (664‚Äâ000 [498‚Äâ000‚Äì847‚Äâ000]). Among these countries, the excess mortality rate was highest in Russia (374¬∑6 deaths [369¬∑7‚Äì378¬∑4] per 100‚Äâ000) and Mexico (325¬∑1 [301¬∑6‚Äì353¬∑3] per 100‚Äâ000), and was similar in Brazil (186¬∑9 [172¬∑2‚Äì199¬∑8] per 100‚Äâ000) and the USA (179¬∑3 [170¬∑7‚Äì187¬∑5] per 100‚Äâ000).
'Our analysis suggests that 18¬∑2 million
(95% UI 17¬∑1‚Äì19¬∑6) people died globally because of the
COVID-19 pandemic (as measured by excess mortality)
between the beginning of the pandemic (Jan 1, 2020) and
the end of Dec 2021, which is 3¬∑07-times (2¬∑88‚Äì3¬∑30)
higher than the reported number of COVID-19-related
deaths. ' (Page 19)

        mainAbs: "In February 2022, Massachusetts rescinded a statewide universal masking policy in public schools, and many Massachusetts school districts lifted masking requirements during the subsequent weeks. In the greater Boston area, only two school districts ‚Äî the Boston and neighboring Chelsea districts ‚Äî sustained masking requirements through June 2022. The staggered lifting of masking requirements provided an opportunity to examine the effect of universal masking policies on the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in schools. We used a difference-in-differences analysis for staggered policy implementation to compare the incidence of Covid-19 among students and staff in school districts in the greater Boston area that lifted masking requirements with the incidence in districts that sustained masking requirements during the 2021‚Äì2022 school year. Characteristics of the school districts were also compared. Before the statewide masking policy was rescinded, trends in the incidence of Covid-19 were similar across school districts. During the 15 weeks after the statewide masking policy was rescinded, the lifting of masking requirements was associated with an additional 44.9 cases per 1000 students and staff (95% confidence interval, 32.6 to 57.1), which corresponded to an estimated 11,901 cases and to 29.4% of the cases in all districts during that time. Districts that chose to sustain masking requirements longer tended to have school buildings that were older and in worse condition and to have more students per classroom than districts that chose to lift masking requirements earlier. In addition, these districts had higher percentages of low-income students, students with disabilities, and students who were English-language learners, as well as higher percentages of Black and Latinx students and staff. Our results support universal masking as an important strategy for reducing Covid-19 incidence in schools and loss of in-person school days. As such, we believe that universal masking may be especially useful for mitigating effects of structural racism in schools, including potential deepening of educational inequities. Among school districts in the greater Boston area, the lifting of masking requirements was associated with an additional 44.9 Covid-19 cases per 1000 students and staff during the 15 weeks after the statewide masking policy was rescinded.",

SARS-CoV-2 is associated with changes in brain structure in UK Biobank

Andersson, Ludovica Griffanti, Eugene Duff, Saad Jbabdi, Bernd Taschler, Peter Keating, Anderson M. Winkler, Rory Collins, Paul M. Matthews, Naomi Allen, Karla L. Miller, Thomas E. Nichols & Stephen M. Smith 
There is strong evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-191,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. However, it remains unknown whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain pathology. Here we investigated brain changes in 785 participants of UK Biobank (aged 51‚Äì81 years) who were imaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, including 401 cases who tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans‚Äîwith 141 days on average separating their diagnosis and the second scan‚Äîas well as 384 controls. The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.

This is very worrisome SARS-CoV-2 is associated with changes in brain structure, including greater reduction in global brain size & larger cognitive decline https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5
It is possible then, judging by the logic and stats presented here, that the ppl in the convoy have already had COVID.
Dr pls introduce vaccine for kids under 12 also. At least parents who accept it will get the chance. Even thru private hospitals.
And our kids‚Ä¶ this is very worrisome‚Ä¶
'We did this
for both a focussed set of a priori-defined IDPs, testing the hypothesis
that the olfactory system is particularly vulnerable in COVID-19, as
well as an exploratory set of analyses considering a much larger set
of IDPs covering the entire brain. In both cases, we identified significant effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily relating to
greater atrophy and increased tissue damage in cortical areas directly
connected to the primary olfactory cortex, as well as to changes in
global measures of brain and cerebrospinal fluid volume.' (Page 2)

Can someone tell me what reason Pharma give for not releasing data is it commercially sensitive
These Pharmas have most of the world politicians and law makers in their pockets. Dishing out billions in backhanders in exchange for no questions and even less liability. There has to be lawyers still with morals to take on these maniacs
Absolutely, but why so few responses?

The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence
Nature Molecular Psychiatry
Joanna Moncrieff, Ruth E. Cooper, Tom Stockmann, Simone Amendola, Michael P. Hengartner & Mark A. Horowitz 
The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression, and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT1A receptor (largest n‚Äâ=‚Äâ561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However, effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ75). Another systematic review (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.

Amazing paper in a journal part of the Nature suite. Finds that there is no evidence linking serotonin to depression - in other words, antidepressants based on serotonin uptake don't work.
Try telling that to those emotionally attached to their antidepressants. Totally commited to the pils. Shorten life as well
I've been reading some work on the way Covid crosses the BBB and interferes with Serotonin levels. There was some light-hearted banter about whether Covid could modify host behaviour as a result. I find myself pondering how plausible this is. What do you think?
There has never been any definitive evidence regarding the mechanism behind depression, so this doesn‚Äôt surprise me.  SSRIs are way overprescribed for anything and everything.
'Our comprehensive review of the major strands of research on
serotonin shows there is no convincing evidence that depression
is associated with, or caused by, lower serotonin concentrations or
activity. ' (Page 11)

Gender Identity 5 Years After Social Transition 
Pediatrics 
Kristina R. Olson, PhD; Lily Durwood, PhD; Rachel Horton, BS; Natalie M. Gallagher, PhD; Aaron Devor, PhD
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Concerns about early childhood social transitions among transgender youth include that these youth may later change their gender identification (ie, retransition), a process that could be distressing. The current study aimed to provide the first estimate of retransitioning and to report the current gender identities of youth an average of 5 years after their initial social transitions. METHODS The current study examined the rate of retransition and current gender identities of 317 initially transgender youth (208 transgender girls, 109 transgender boys; M = 8.1 years at start of study) participating in a longitudinal study, the Trans Youth Project. Data were reported by youth and their parents through in-person or online visits or via e-mail or phone correspondence. RESULTS We found that an average of 5 years after their initial social transition, 7.3% of youth had retransitioned at least once. At the end of this period, most youth identified as binary transgender youth (94%), including 1.3% who retransitioned to another identity before returning to their binary transgender identity. A total of 2.5% of youth identified as cisgender and 3.5% as nonbinary. Later cisgender identities were more common among youth whose initial social transition occurred before age 6 years; their retransitions often occurred before age 10 years. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that retransitions are infrequent. More commonly, transgender youth who socially transitioned at early ages continued to identify that way. Nonetheless, understanding retransitions is crucial for clinicians and families to help make retransitions as smooth as possible for youth.

Recent prospective study in the leading pediatrics journal showed 97.5% of trans youth persist in their gender identity after 5 years. It's never enough though. They always move the goal posts and say just wait 5 more years.  https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/2/e2021056082/186992/Gender-Identity-5-Years-After-Social-Transition?autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
I was just looking at it tonight so it's fresh on my mind: Transgender Trend spins this as "social transition just puts them on a permanent path they can't change out of if they wanted to.'
I have an idea: wait 18 years.
This study is of early transitioning children, i.e. they were all still children by the end of the study. It tells us nothing about the persistence into adulthood. It also excludes children who  transition later as teenagers, which is where we are now seeing the massive increase.
(An average of 5.37 years
(SD 5 1.74 years) after their initial
binary social transition, most
participants were living as binary
transgender youth (94.0%; Table 2).
Included in this group were 4
individuals (1.3% of the total
sample) who retransitioned twice
(to nonbinary then back to binary
transgender). Some youth (3.5%)
were currently living as nonbinary,
including one who had
retransitioned first to cisgender then
to nonbinary. ) (Page 3)

The illusion of evidence based medicine
https://x.com/DanJohnsonAB/status/1614981024332795910
Of course everything called ‚Äúevidence-based‚Äù isn‚Äôt necessarily so. It‚Äôs true in medical research, but also for agriculture, environment, nutrition, ecosystem health, product testing, and anywhere where sales and ease of application are priorities. 
Evidence gathered treating other people.
What is evidence to an unintelligent person is not necessarily evidence to an intelligent person. Most evidence presented eg in a court of law is thrown out for one reason or another. Also, what is the motive behind someone labeling something as evidence or not is important.
A friend of mine used to work at a big Pharma co in the labs, testing (evidence-based), if the results weren't what they wanted, they buried them.

Discriminatory attitudes against unvaccinated people during the pandemic
Alexander Bor, Frederik J√∏rgensen & Michael Bang Petersen 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, sizeable groups of unvaccinated people persist even in countries with high vaccine access1. As a consequence, vaccination became a controversial subject of debate and even protest2. Here we assess whether people express discriminatory attitudes in the form of negative affectivity, stereotypes and exclusionary attitudes in family and political settings across groups defined by COVID-19 vaccination status. We quantify discriminatory attitudes between vaccinated and unvaccinated citizens in 21 countries, covering a diverse set of cultures across the world. Across three conjoined experimental studies (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ15,233), we demonstrate that vaccinated people express discriminatory attitudes towards unvaccinated individuals at a level as high as discriminatory attitudes that are commonly aimed at immigrant and minority populations3,4,‚Äî5. By contrast, there is an absence of evidence that unvaccinated individuals display discriminatory attitudes towards vaccinated people, except for the presence of negative affectivity in Germany and the USA. We find evidence in support of discriminatory attitudes against unvaccinated individuals in all countries except for Hungary and Romania, and find that discriminatory attitudes are more strongly expressed in cultures with stronger cooperative norms. Previous research on the psychology of cooperation has shown that individuals react negatively against perceived ‚Äòfree-riders‚Äô6,7, including in the domain of vaccinations8,9. Consistent with this, we find that contributors to the public good of epidemic control (that is, vaccinated individuals) react with discriminatory attitudes towards perceived free-riders (that is, unvaccinated individuals). National leaders and vaccinated members of the public appealed to moral obligations to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake10,11, but our findings suggest that discriminatory attitudes‚Äîincluding support for the removal of fundamental rights‚Äîsimultaneously emerged.

New study: May, 2021: Across 21 countries the COVID-19 vaxxed possessed discriminatory views (e.g., "Deny them medical care!") against the unvaxxed similar to that of racists. The hateful "get the shot or get shot" view was commonly expressed on Twitter. https://nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05607-y
When the core is wrong, everything else follows. Racism stems from the arrogance of mob rule which can be applied to every facet of the fascists meaningless life.
And now... the volume of dying suddenly and aggressive cancers reports are superseding such hateful tweets. The truth will finally come out to all,
I‚Äôve heard people say the unvaxed deserve to die. But we were Faucied by ‚ÄúI am science‚Äù himself on behalf of Big Pharma. Let‚Äôs never be Faucied again.
'Furthermore, we found that discriminatory attitudes towards unvaccinated individuals is as high or higher
than discriminatory attitudes directed towards other common and
diverse targets of prejudice including immigrants, drug-addicts and
ex-convicts. ' (Page 7)
